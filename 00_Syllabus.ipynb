    "## Use of Python / MATLABÂ®\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a software package like Python or MATLAB is very helpful in the study of Feedback Systems. \n",
    "The software can best be used initially to check work that is first done traditionally with pencil and paper. This is particularly helpful when verifying polar plots (Nyquist plots), Bode diagrams and root loci when first attempting to sketch these functions. \n",
    "In addition, step responses in the time domain can be examined in order to build an intuitive sense of the relations between time and frequency domain behavior. \n",
    "We also will use Pyton to check the validity of simplifying approximations that are often made when carrying out preliminary designs. Finally we can study more complex problems with a computer-aided design package without the enormous burden of doing extensive computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest that everyone become familiar with the use of Python or MATLAB. Remember that we want you to come away with an understanding of feedback theory in some depth. The computer is to aid in achieving this understanding and should be used intelligently as an engineering tool."
